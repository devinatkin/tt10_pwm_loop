## How it works

This project is a fixed version of a lab created for ENEL 453. The input bits will create the calculated crc value on the output bits. 
If there's enough space I'll add additional bits past the 8 bits to make this larger or allow the crc to be programmed; however, I doubt there will be enough space. 

## How to test

This will be a micro tile alongside some other projects 

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
